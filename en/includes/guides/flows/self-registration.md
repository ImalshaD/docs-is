# Self registration

Self-registration allows new users to create an account within your organization without the need for admin intervention. The flow can include steps to collect user details, verify identity and set credentials before the account becomes active.

In the **Flow Builder**, you can create a self registration journey in two ways:

- **Use a starter template** – Load a ready made flow and customize it to your needs.

- **Build from scratch** – Take full control by designing every step yourself.

## Sample use case

Imagine you want to simplify the self-registration form to only request the essential details from users. For added security, you also want to verify the user's mobile number before creating the account. The flow works as follows.

- The user enters the email, mobile number and password.
- {{product_name}} sends a **one-time code** to the user's registered mobile number.
- The user verifies the mobile number by entering the code.
- {{product_name}} creates the user's account.

This ensures that only users with a valid mobile number can self-register, helping to prevent fake or fraudulent sign-ups.

## Build it

To build the sample use case, you can start from the Basic Details template and adjust it to:

- Request only email, mobile and password attributes from the user.
- Make entering a mobile number mandatory.
- Change the **Sign Up** button to point to the mobile verification step.
- Insert an **SMS OTP** step.

Follow the steps below to configure this flow.

### Step 1 – Load the template

To load the template,

1. Navigate to **Home** > **Flows**.

2. Click on the **Self Registration** card.

3. Click the `+` button next to the **Basic Details** template.

### Step 2 – Keep only email, mobile, and password fields

We can simplify the form to collect only the essentials for registration and ensure that mobile is mandatory for SMS OTP verification later.

1. In the first Sign Up view, keep only the fields **Email**, **Mobile**, and **Password**, and delete the rest.

2. Click on the **Mobile** field and tick the **Required** checkbox in **Input Properties** pane to make it mandatory.

3. Click **Save Draft** to keep your progress.

### Step 3 – Remove the existing connection

We can now remove the direct link from the sign up button to the success state so we can insert the SMS OTP verification step in between.

1. Locate the line that connects the **Sign Up** button to the **green tick**.
2. Click on this line and delete it.

### Step 4 – Change sign up button action to navigation

We should now make the sign up button move the user to the next step (SMS OTP) instead of finalizing the registration immediately.

1. Click the **Sign Up** button.
2. Change its action from **Onboard Password** to **Navigation**.

### Step 5 – Add an SMS OTP verification step

This step verifies the mobile number provided during sign up before completing account creation.

1. Navigate to the **Steps** section and drag and drop an **SMS OTP View** onto the canvas.

2. Connect the **Sign Up** button to the **SMS OTP View** and connect the **Verify** button to the green tick.
        ![Step 5.2]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/flows/flow-registration-step-05-2.gif){: width="auto" style="display: block; margin: 0;"}

3. Click **Save Draft** to save your changes. When ready, toggle the switch on the top right corner to **Enable** and publish the updated flow.

With these changes, new users will only provide the essentials **Email**, **mobile number**, and **password** and must verify their mobile via SMS OTP before completing registration.

!!! Note
        When using a connection based sign up option (such as Google or Microsoft), configure the authorized redirect URL as: `https://accounts.asgardeo.io/t/{tenant-domain}/accounts/register`
